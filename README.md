# Blog Post Manager

This is a simple web application that lets you create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to manage blog content in a clean interface.

## Features

- Displays a list of blog titles
- Click on a title to see full blog details including author, image, and content
- Add new blogs using a form with title, author, image URL, and content
- Edit or delete existing blogs directly from the detail view
- Shows the total number of blogs available

## How to Run

1. You need a backend API running at `http://localhost:3000/Blogs`. You can easily set this up using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with your JSON data.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the form to add blogs, and click on blog titles to view or manage them.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML page
- `index.css` – Stylesheet for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript handling fetching, rendering, and user interactions
- `db.json` – JSON file containing initial blog data for the API
